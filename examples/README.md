# NetGraph Examples

Examples of usage of the NetGraph package.


## Note about dependencies

The `Simple Java Plot` written by Yuriy Guskov has been used for the generation of the plotted graphs. 

Since it is a standalone file, a translation in Kotlin has been added in the `helpers` folder to avoid dependencies.

You can find the documentation on 
[gh-pages](http://yuriy-g.github.io/simple-java-plot/ "Simple Java Plot on github.io").
